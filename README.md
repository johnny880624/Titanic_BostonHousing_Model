# Introduction
Titanic and Boston Housing are two of classical Kaggle Competitions and my machine learning initial point as well.

## Method in Titanic
1. Craving my model from the scratch and didn't using any package to fulfill the model building. [The Titanic_level 1](https://github.com/johnny880624/Titanic-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Titanic%26BostonHousing/titanic_level1.py)  
2. Utilizing package such as scikit-learn to develop my model.[The Titanic_level 2](https://github.com/johnny880624/Titanic-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Titanic%26BostonHousing/titanic_level2.py)  
## Method in Boston
1. applying package such as scikit-learn to develop my model. [Boston-Housing](https://github.com/johnny880624/Titanic-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Titanic%26BostonHousing/boston_housing_competition.py)
