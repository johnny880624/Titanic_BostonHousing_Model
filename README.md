# Introduction
Titanic and Boston Housing are two of classical Kaggle Competitions and my machine learning initial point as well.    
Titanic(Classification problem): Based on attributes such as age, sex, Embarked and etc...., we buld the model to predict whether the customer is dead or not.  
Boston Housing(Linear Regression problem): According attributes like location, room size, room age and etc...., we develop the model to forecast the price of the housing.

## Method in Titanic
1. Craving my model from the scratch and didn't using any package to fulfill the model building_[The Titanic_level 1](https://github.com/johnny880624/Titanic-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Titanic%26BostonHousing/titanic_level1.py).  
2. Utilizing package such as scikit-learn to develop my model_[The Titanic_level 2](https://github.com/johnny880624/Titanic-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Titanic%26BostonHousing/titanic_level2.py).  
## Method in Boston
1. applying package such as scikit-learn to develop my model_[Boston-Housing](https://github.com/johnny880624/Titanic-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Titanic%26BostonHousing/boston_housing_competition.py).
