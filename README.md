# Introduction

The Titanic and Boston Housing datasets represent two classic Kaggle competitions, and they also served as the starting point for my journey into machine learning.    

For the Titanic dataset (a Classification problem), the challenge involves predicting the survival of passengers based on various attributes such as age, sex, embarkation point, and others. We developed a model that analyzes these factors to determine the likelihood of a passenger's survival during the tragic sinking of the Titanic.  

In the Boston Housing dataset (a Linear Regression problem), the task is to forecast housing prices based on attributes like location, room size, age of the property, and more. We created a model that takes these characteristics into account, enabling it to predict the market value of houses in the Boston area.   

Both of these projects not only provided fundamental insights into different types of machine learning problems but also laid the groundwork for further exploration and development in the field.    

## Methods in Titanic
1. Developing my model from scratch, without relying on pre-existing packages for model building._[The Titanic_level 1](https://github.com/johnny880624/Titanic-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Titanic%26BostonHousing/titanic_level1.py).  
2. Leveraging a package called scikit-learn to develop my model._[The Titanic_level 2](https://github.com/johnny880624/Titanic-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Titanic%26BostonHousing/titanic_level2.py).  
## Method in Boston Housing
1. Applying a package called scikit-learn to build my model_[Boston-Housing](https://github.com/johnny880624/Titanic-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Titanic%26BostonHousing/boston_housing_competition.py).
